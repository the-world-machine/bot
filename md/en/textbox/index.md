# Textbox Documentation

## Commands

You can use special commmands mid-sentence to do various stuff (like changing the facepic or coloring text), using `\c[arguments]` syntax (you can omit [] if there's no arguments). This is an almost direct copy of how [OneShot Textbox Maker](https://github.com/Leo40Git/OneShot-Textbox-Maker/) does this, check that project out if you want (even though it's archived), it's a java program that lets you make dialogues like the command in this bot too.<br/>

> `name` - Description - `example`

> ### `@` - Change facepic - `\@[OneShot/Niko/af]`
>
> This accepts three arguments separated by a colon (`:`)
>
> 1. the path for the facepic. you can find all of these [in this file](https://github.com/the-world-machine/bot/blob/main/src/data/facepics.yml), they are listed in '`name`: `discord emoji id` # `credits`' layout, or by using the facepic selector in the textbox dialogue builder using the bot. When writing the paths manually, make sure to not put "characters" or "faces" in the paths.
>
> - optional string
>
> 2. the transformation to apply to the image **(not implemented yet)**
>
> - optional string
>
> 3. the position for the face in the textbox **(not implemented yet)**
>
> - optional string

> ### `n` - Line break - `\n`
>
> Self explanatory (probably shouldn't be included, but it's a command nonetheless)

## Raw file editing (.tbb)

This is a generic text file that has the entire State (all the dialogue frames and everything) saved inside it. It's usually outputted right above the preview for a frame, you can use this to export/import a dialogue you've made, or edit it in a text editor of your preference instead of using Discord.

### Parsing

The file is parsed line by line. The parser first looks for the `#> StateOptions <#` marker to know that the following lines are for [`StateOptions`](#stateoptions). It then looks for the `#> Frames <#` marker, after which it parses the lines for [`Frames`](#frames). Any lines starting with `#` or that are empty are ignored.

### `StateOptions`:

A newline separated list of key=value pairs. All of them can be omitted, the default value will be used instead

> `filetype` # Output filetype
>
> - text, one of WEBP, GIF, APNG, PNG, JPEG (default: "WEBP")
>   APNG: this sends it as a file without a filename, because Discord breaks them upon upload for some reason

> `send_to` # Whether to send the output to the channel or dms
>
> - number, one of: 1, 2, 3 (default: 1)
>   1. Doesn't send anywhere, replies to the textbox in an ephemeral message
>   2. Sends in Direct Messages of runner
>   3. Sends to the current channel. If the bot isn't in the server - the bot tries to followup with a normal message (runner needs External Apps in order for this to actually send the message)

> `force_send` # Whether to ignore checks before sending (e.g. no facepic being set or no text being set)
>
> - boolean true/false (default: false)

> `quality` # Quality
>
> - number, range: 1..=100 (default: 100)

### `Frames`:

A newline separated list of frames. Each frame has an options and text field, separated by a semicolon, options are wrapped in braces for ease of editing ({options};text).

#### `options`

> 1. `animated` # Whether the text should be animated
>
> - boolean, true/false (default: true)

> 2. `end_delay` # How many milliseconds to wait before showing the end arrow
>
> - number, range: 1.. (default: 150)

> 3. `end_arrow_bounces` # How many bounces should the end arrow make
>
> - number, range: 1.. (default: 4)

> 4. `end_arrow_delay` # How many milliseconds to wait between arrow bounces
>
> - number, range: 1.. (default: 150)

#### `text`

Text content for the frame (this supports [commands](#commands))

### Example

```
#> StateOptions <#
force_send=True
send_to=3
#> Frames <#
{True;150;4;150;;};\\@[OneShot (fan)/Nikonlanger/Smug]Meow :3
```
