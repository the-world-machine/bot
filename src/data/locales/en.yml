    Hey, Hey! Welcome to my emporium. I'm willing to trade many shiny and colorful treasures, backgrounds, capsules and more in exchange for your [emoji:wool]**Wool**... think of it as a currency eh?


    To get started, simply open one of the categories shown below and then trade away! Keep in mind that there are some items that change **daily**, so keep an eye out on those!


    [motd]

  motds:
    - The wool market changes everyday. Honestly, we bird people have a good intuition about it, and by intuition I mean I randomly increase it or decrease it to whatever I feel like.
    - I may have *broken* the wool market once or twice. Let's keep that between us.
    - "Words of wisdom as a friend: If you buy high and sell low, good fortune awaits..! Don't fact check that!"
    - My poor trinket and treasures were washed away... perhaps you could find more for me?
    - You're asking about what happened to that one trader before me? I wouldn't know. *I wouldn't know at all...* # During the World Machine Edition AMA Nightmargin jokingly said that Magpie hid a body which has not been found yet. Considering the fact that the purple trader is nowhere to be found in the remake, it is the most likely victim of this alleged crime.
    - 'Do you like my bottle collection? I like my bottle collection. What do you mean it''s all "Hard Liquor"? Is that what it says?' # Magpie's drink of choice is hard liquor, but only so he can collect the bottles afterwards.

  traded: '> Successfully traded for [amount] of "[item_name]"!' # [price] is also available here
  traded_sell: '> Sucessfully traded in [amount] "[item_name]" for [price] Wool!'

      I see you're interested in this weird capsule thingamajig!
      If I recall correctly, this is used to unlock **Nikogotchis!**
      What are *Nikogotchis* you might ask? Well my dear customer, they are simple pets you can take care off, based of me, or any other...


      ...


      *AHEM* existential dread aside, feeding them with pancakes and taking good care of them will allow you to gather treasures! Which you can trade to me! Pretty cool right?


      So why not trade for a capsule today? Only [emoji:wool]**[cost]**!


      *Do keep in mind that you can only have **one capsule** per Nikogotchi.*
